# Focus Browser

An experimental firefox fork designed to minimize distractions and maximize focus.

</div>

## Goals

- Minimalist ui that feels more native than firefox's (custom skin, not a rewrite)
- Replace some internal firefox components with better open source alternatives (e.g. uBlock origin)
- Remove mozilla's telemetry, ads and pocket

## Credits

- Dot HQ's [melon build tool](https://github.com/dothq/melon), which was extracted from Dot Browser. They have been driving development of firefox forks and have made incredible progress.
- The [BetterFox](https://github.com/yokoffing/Better-Fox) user.js tweaks, which are used throughout the browser.
- [Firefox](https://fireofox.com) and the rest of the mozilla team.
